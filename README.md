### üöÄ Setup 

1.  **Be sure to have `button-card` and `card-mod` installed.** You can get them via HACS.

2.  Copy the content of the `templates` directory and paste it into the top of your Dashboard yaml. You can access this by clicking **Edit dashboard** -\> **three dots** -\> **Raw configuration editor**.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** Be sure you **do not delete the views key** below the templates. This is basically your dashboard configuration and deleting it will delete your  UI.

    It should look something like this:

    ``` yaml
    button_card_templates:
        room_card_action:
        ...
        room_card:
        ...
        notification_card:
        ...
        notification_card_action:
        ...

    views: ...  
    ```

### üß© Using the Templates

Once you set up the templates, you can create cards that use them.

```yaml
type: custom:button-card
template: room_card
name: Kitchen
```

See the `card_examples` directory for full card configurations.

### üé® Themes

If you like how this dashboard looks, you can find the themes I'm using in the `themes` folder.

1.  **Copy the Theme Files**: Copy the theme files (e.g., `minimalist-desktop.yaml`, `minimalist-mobile.yaml`) into a `themes` directory in your Home Assistant `config` folder.

2.  **Update `configuration.yaml`**: Edit your `configuration.yaml` file to enable the themes and point to the directory. Add the following lines:

    ```yaml
    frontend:
      themes: !include_dir_merge_named themes
    ```

3.  **Restart and Select Theme**: After saving `configuration.yaml` and restarting Home Assistant, the new themes will be available in your user profile settings.
